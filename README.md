<b>Airports with Air Traffic Control Towers by State</b>

This project maps airports within the United States (including AL, HI, and Puerto Rico) while also indicating which airports also have Air Traffic Control towers. Additioanlly, this map also indicates which states have the most airports and which have the fewest, through an easy to follow cloropleth map. This map should be very useful for pilots (especially hobbyists and amateurs), or even smaller airports.

The airport data for this map comes from Data.gov and can be found at [here]. Additioanlly, the spatial data for the United States is provided by [Mike Bostock] of [D3]. The basemap used in this project is provided by CartoBD.
